Interval Timer

I wanted a interval timer to use when exercising, one that I could set with a time, a rest interval and a number of rounds. I couldn't find one that I liked, so I hacked one togther. 

It is made in angular using <Yeoman's *http://yeoman.io/* ="link"> <angular generator *https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular* ="link"> for scaffolding. 

<Project Creation ="h">


First job is to make sure you have <npm (Node Package Manager) *https://www.npmjs.com/* ="link"> installed. From this you can then install everything else we will need. The rest, in no particular order are: grunt, grunt-cli (command line), bower, yo, generator-karma (for testing) generator-angular. For installin the generators you can also do this through Yeoman's command line interface. 

< 
  npm install grunt 
  npm install grunt-cli
  npm install bower 
  npm install yo 
  npm install generator-karma
  npm install generator-angular

<HTML & CSS ="h">

Now we can add in the HTML and CSS to make the site look presentable.

We have two main sections in the HTML, the input/display and the control buttons. 

The input/display code, below, has a section for both the input and display. Later we will tie the input/output values, and control for displaying each part to javascript variables.

Finally I added a short title and image. I got this image off of a free image hosting site.

<div class="titleBlock">

  <h1> Interval Timer </h1>

<div class="numbers">
  <div class="input-group">
    
    <span class="input-group-addon">Time</span>
    <input type="number" step="1" min="0"  class="form-control">
    
    <span class="input-group-addon">Interval</span>
    <input type="number" step="1" min="0"  class="form-control">
    
    <span class="input-group-addon">Rounds</span>
    <input type="number" step="1"  min="0"  class="form-control">

  </div>

  <div class="display" >
    <h4>
